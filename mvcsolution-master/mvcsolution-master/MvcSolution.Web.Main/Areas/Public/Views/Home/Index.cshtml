        <p>
            The source code on github there shows a common solution architecture for ASP.NET MVC websites.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            I tried to write the minimum code to demonstrate the architecture, so you will find it's quite light weight.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            Actually the source code is not for copy-and-use. It's more like a reference to the documentation.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            The documentation should be much more useful than the source code if you carefully read it.
